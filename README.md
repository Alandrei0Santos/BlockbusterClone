# Blockbuster Clone

Blockbuster Clone is a fake movie rental store in which you can query for movies, see their details, add another one, delete and edit.

This project prepares the back-end to provide CRUD operations with MongoDB using ASP.Net Core 6. It does not provide a user interface, but you can interact with the database through Swagger.

Although there are multiple ways test this project on your machine, I'm going to give some instructions on how to set it up:

- Clone this project
- Install Visual Studio with ASP.NET framework
- Open the file you cloned on Visual Studio
- Build the project
  - If you're asked to install certificates, you may choose to do it or not.
  - Not installing certificates will make the browser detect an "nonsafe website", which you can simply ignore and access the page anyways
