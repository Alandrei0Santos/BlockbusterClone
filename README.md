# Blockbuster Clone

Blockbuster Clone is a fake movie rental store in which you can query for movies, see their details, add another one, delete and edit.

This project prepares the back-end to provide CRUD operations with MongoDB using ASP.Net Core 6. It does not provide a user interface, but you can interact with the database through Swagger.
